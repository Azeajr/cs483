Give implementation-level description of a Turing machine M that decides the language A = {w1~w2| w1,w2 ∈ {0,1}*, w2 is bitwise complement of w1}. For example, M should accept “101~010” and reject “101~101”. Hint: see the Turing machine M1 in the book.
Give a formal description of M including a state diagram for δ.
Implement M  (show the code) for the  TMSimulator . Run the machine on the simulator and show the sequence of configurations that M enters when started on the string “10~01”.
Show that if languages L1 and L2 are decidable, then the intersection of L1 and L2 is also decidable.
Show that if languages L1 and L2 are decidable, then concatenation of L1 and L2 is also decidable.
Show that if languages L1 and L2 are recognizable, then the intersection of L1 and L2 is also recognizable.
Show that if languages L1 and L2 are recognizable, then the concatenation of L1 and L2 is also recognizable.
Show that language B = {⟨A⟩| A is a DFA and L(A) = Σ* } is decidable.
Show that language C = {<D, R> | D is a DFA, R is a regular expression and L(D) = L(R)}  is decidable.
